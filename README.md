#### ALIEN 

The game is a 2D platform game where the alien moves down screen heading to earth on clouds collecting coins and lives aiming towards achieving a high score and a coin score. As the alien progresses down screen the score accumulates by the players successful movement down screen on the white clouds. The player must make sure he dodges the dark cloud or he will lose a life or die. Depending on the players score the game will change between difficulty levels of easy, medium or hard. The player will also die if he goes out of bounds on the screen.

#### Technologies 

The game was built in Unity 5.4.2(version) using C# scripts connected to gameobjects. Sprites, background images and menus were downloaded from opengameart.org. I used Udemy and YouTube tutorials for research and github for saving and storing my files.

#### Project 

The game was an individual project, I was lookin to gain the experience of creating a 2d game and done some research into the best available technology. It was something I never done before and would be a really big challenge. I decided to do it in Unity which was an overall enjoyable experience with many hours of frustration involved. I followed tutorials on youtube as well as a course on Udemy. I found that after getting familiar with the Unity interface and studying how to import my assets, how to create and connect scripts to gameobjects I planned out the type of game I wanted to build. Basic 2D platform game collecting coins and lives and to learn how to use the different technologies in Unity.
