# ALIEN 

The game is a 2D platform game where the alien moves down screen heading to earth on clouds collecting coins and lives aiming towards achieving a high score and a coin score. As the alien progresses down screen the score accumulates by the players successful movement down screen on the white clouds. The player must make sure he dodges the dark cloud or he will lose a life or die. Depending on the players score the game will change between difficulty levels of easy, medium or hard. The player will also die if he goes out of bounds on the screen.

The game was built in Unity 5.4.2(version) using C#
